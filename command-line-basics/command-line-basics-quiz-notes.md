## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a CLI?
  A CLI (Command Line Interface) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer or software by typing commands. It is commonly used for system administration, development, and scripting. Unlike a GUI, a CLI requires users to memorize and enter commands manually.
- What is a GUI?
  A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a visual interface that enables users to interact with a computer using graphical elements such as buttons, icons, and windows. It is more user-friendly than a CLI because it does not require command-line knowledge and is typically used in consumer applications.

  - `man`
    man ls
